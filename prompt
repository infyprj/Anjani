The above DAL methods  i thought can be useful and implemented. I ensure you that all are working well.
Now I need to complete the front-end part of 3 user stories using angular. Those 3 user stories are searching products,filterbycategory,
navigation bar for the application and "no products available" has to be displayed if the required products are not available in the database.
for each product there should be enable two buttons of "update" and "delete" if the user is Admin.
if other than admin opens the website the products should be displayed normally only.

the below is the database schema of our shop3DApp
